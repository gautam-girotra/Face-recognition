# Face-recognition
Creating a database from images of five cricketers and performing face recognition on test images.
This project performs facial recognition on a small set of images of five cricketers.
We first create a database from these images then use it to recognise unseen images of these cricketers.
It also recognises whether the person in the given image exists in the database or not.
